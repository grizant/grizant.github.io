title: STAT 429-629 Intro to Bayesian Statistics
exclude: true
---

I'll introduce Bayesian statistics using similar topics in an upper-level classical (frequentist) statistics course. We'll focus on statistical inference using Bayes' Theorem for familiar continuous and discrete random variables (such as Normal and binomial), while comparing Bayesian to classical approaches throughout. Near the end of the course, we'll touch on modern Bayesian computation to apply theory to real data, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior sampling.

# Course tools and information
- In DMSC 106, the computers will have all the software installed.<br/>(Please install on your personal machines as needed.)
- R: Install [R](http://www.r-project.org/) first, then install [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).<br/>(Alternatively, advanced users could use other IDEs with markdown support such as [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with [ESS-mode](https://ess.r-project.org/) and [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/), but this is not recommended for new users and will not be supported during instruction.)
- R Coding style guidelines from Advanced R by H.~Wickham: [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html){:target="_blank"}
- If you want to use RMarkdown to produce a PDF, you must install LaTeX on your machine. Click [this page for instructions](http://www.pauljhurtado.com/latex/){:target="_blank"}.
- See UNR's [Dr. Paul Hurtado's R page](http://www.pauljhurtado.com/R/){:target="_blank"} for tons of great information. <br/> And/or the textbook author's R tutorials: [dist.stat.tamu.edu/pub/rvideos/](http://dist.stat.tamu.edu/pub/rvideos/){:target="_blank"}.
- Rmarkdown Resources: [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com){:target="_blank"}
- RStudio cheatsheets (many are highly useful, the old version of the Rmarkdown is recommended): [www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/){:target="_blank"}
- Great introduction to statistics by Prof Joe Watkins at the University of Ariziona: [Stat Course](http://math.arizona.edu/~jwatkins/math363s17.htm){:target="_blank"}. Make sure to check out his book linked on that page.

Interested in natural resources?

- WaterStat has numerous spreadsheets that characterize water footprints and virtual water data. The data primarily characterizes water use for agricultural and biofuel production as well as national statistics on water use:
[http://waterfootprint.org/en/resources/waterstat/](http://waterfootprint.org/en/resources/waterstat/){:target="_blank"}

- AQUASTAT has data on water use, water resources, irrigation, and other general statistics at a national level across several decades for most countries:
[http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/results.html](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/results.html){:target="_blank"}

- The USGS has tons of water related data, generally at the county level
[https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis){:target="_blank"}

- Canada also has some excellent environmental data resources, such as OECD and StatCan. StatCan is focused on the flow of natural resources into production sectors and impacts to the environment:
